Brief Reflection: I did use AI tools for help with syntax and debugging, but I reviewed everything, tested it, and made sure I can explain every line.
 I also checked for mistakes like incorrect JSON usage or unsafe file handling.

 Lesson Learned:
 One key concept I learned this week is the difference between json.load() / json.dump()
 and why Modular Design makes projects easier to scale and that i can use emoji keys in vscode for easier understanding
 due to I had to use AI (ChatGPT) to ask some questions about why i was having troubles with my syntax and debugging on one of my files.
